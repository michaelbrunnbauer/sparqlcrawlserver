Sparql Crawl Server is a Java Web application that crawls a list of URLs 
containing RDF and executes a SPARQL query on the resulting graphs.  
Every document gets its own named graph with the final document URL as 
graph name. Already crawled documents are cached in memory and on disk.

The crawler supports RDF/XML, RDFa, N3 and Turtle and will open a maximum 
of one HTTP connection per server IP. It respects the Robot Exclusion Standard.

HTTP POST request parameters (UTF-8 encoded):

  query: The SPARQL query.
  graphs: A comma separated list of URLs in <>: <url1>,<url2>,...
  timeout: number of seconds to wait for the RDF documents.

HTTP Response: application/sparql-results+json

If the timeout is reached, the SPARQL query will be executed with the current
results. RDF from unfinished HTTP requests is added to the cache when finished.

Build instructions:

Configure the path to your settings file in 

 SparqlCrawlServer/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml.

Build by invoking ant.
Minimum Java version is 7.0, minimum Servlet version is 3.0.

Deploy the file SparqlCrawlServer.war in your Servlet container (e.g. Tomcat 7).

The context-path of the servlet is /sparqlcrawl (so, normally the
endpoint URL is http://<your-server>/SparqlCrawlServer/sparqlcrawl).

Settings file:

The settings file is a groovy file, see example-settings.groovy.
